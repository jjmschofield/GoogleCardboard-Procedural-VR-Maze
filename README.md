# GoogleCardboard-Procedural-VR-Maze
## Key Features
* Mobile VR implementation (Google Cardboard)
* Procedurally generated maze using a randomized variant of Primm's algorithm
* Graph based data structure (though the maze is effectively implemented in a square formation at this time)
* Procedurally generated environment mesh
* Procedurally generated gaze and teleportation based navigation system
